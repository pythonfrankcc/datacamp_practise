'''when dealing with categorical data you can resort to three ways:
1)dropping the categorical features
2)label encoding
3)one-hot encoding
>>categorical features are sometimes referred to as niominal variables and thus this means that there is no predetermined 
order in there order such as male or female
but there are also:
>>ordinal variables which means that there is a predefined order lets say high,low and medium
for tree based models like random forest and random forests they work well witrh ordinal variables


>>one hot encoding creates new columns indicating the presence or absence of each possible value in the oroginal data
>>one hot encoding also does well with the unordered sequences(nominal) but cannot be used for large sets of more
15 different features
